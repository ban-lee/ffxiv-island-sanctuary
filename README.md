# FFXIV: Island Sanctuary Workshop Planner
[Final Fantasy XIV](https://www.finalfantasyxiv.com/) is an amazing game but their Island Sanctuary Workshop UI just
wasn't enough and scheduling took forever. So I made a small tool to help!

**Features**
- Choose only the handicrafts the give an Efficiency Bonus!
- View the Popularity x Supply value bonus next to the handicrafts!
